### Day One of developing software known as FeeFinder

#### Introduction 

* To begin we analysed the brief and the PDF document that was provided. 
* Once we outlined why the Application would be useful we began to analyse why it should be done electronically?
* We then began to outline the STEPS we would take in order to undertake the project.
* Once the STEPS were formalised we began discovery phase of software to be used and why?	
* Once the software was decided upon to make the App using the Web Application Development library Sinatra with the use  of programming language Ruby. 
* However prior to the development phase we had to understand the importance of Test Driven Development and tests such as RSPEC.

Futhermore it was suggested that we look at how the user is going to recieve the information aswell.
